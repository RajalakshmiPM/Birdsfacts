  <h3>Birds Facts</h3>
  <p>There are numerous species of bird found in a wide variety of habitats all round the world. Birds are one of the most thriving groups of animals on the planet as they generally have their habitat to themselves. </p>
  <br>
  <p>Birds can be easily distinguished from other animals due to their sharp, pointed beaks, thin legs, wings and feathers covering their bodies. Although all birds species have wings, some are actually flightless animals that only use their wings for balance and not for flying. Where other birds, such as penguins, use their wings for swimming.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Birds are often omnivorous animals, generally eating nearly anything that they can find. Most species of bird survive on a diet primarily consisting  of insects and plants such as fruits, nuts, berries and seeds.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Birds are also distinctive in the fact that they lay eggs in a similar way to other animal groups such as fish and reptiles. Birds often make nests in the trees or on the ground in which to lay their eggs.</p>
